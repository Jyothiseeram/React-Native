    <p>The name "Jerry" was chosen by Geraint Rowlands, who submitted "Tom and Jerry" as potential names for the duo after an important Loews Inc. 
        distributor in Texas asked for follow-ups to Puss Gets the Boot.[2] While the idea of a cat-and-mouse duo was considered shopworn by the 1940s,[2] Hanna and Barbera decided to expand upon the standard expected cat and mouse relationship. 
        Instead of being a "cowering victim" of Tom, he took delight in besting, and even torturing, his feline frenemy (even if Tom is just following orders or is even just minding his own business and is antagonized by Jerry). 
        Hanna and Barbera considered Tom and Jerry "the best of enemies", whose rivalry hid an unspoken amount of mutual caring and respect for one another.[4]</p>
      <p style="font-family:cursive">Tom and Jerry aren't always enemies; they have been known to team up on occasion. The first Tom and Jerry short/film that Jerry was in is Puss Gets the Boot, and the last is The Karate Guard, the 163rd Tom and Jerry film. 
        Jerry has been on the Tom and Jerry film series from 1940 to the present.</p>
